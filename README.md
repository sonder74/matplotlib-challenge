## Project Goals
With this project, I set out to improve my Python coding ability, become more adept with Pandas dataframes, and learn to do something entirely new: plot data using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, a library used for creating static, animated, and interactive data visualizations.
