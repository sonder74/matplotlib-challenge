## Project Goals
With this project, I set out to improve my Python coding ability, become more adept with Pandas dataframes, and learn to do something entirely new: plot data using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, a library used for creating static, animated, and interactive data visualizations. This project's tasked focused on data gathered from medical research on mice.

## Tools and Solutions
As stated above, I relied on Python and its Matplotlib library to complete the project's tasks--but it was also necessary to import assets from <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Sklearn</a> to get the job done. I employed bar charts, pie charts, box plots, line graphs, and scatter plots to explore the data and draw conclusions. This project also served as my introduction to statistial analysis, and I plotted my first linear regression equation, which modeled a correlation between mouse weight and the size of tumors.

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned
This project was a bit of a stretch for me (particularly when it came to plotting the linear-regression model), but I enjoyed it and look forward to more work with both Python and Matplotlib. You can take a look at all of my code and visualizations showing several different types of correlations <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/matplotlib-challenge/blob/master/pymaceuticals_final.ipynb">here</a>.
